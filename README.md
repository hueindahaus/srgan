# Super resolution GAN :sparkles:

This repository presents a generative adversarial network model to super resolute imaging systems inspired by [SRGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802) and [ESRGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219). The implementation is done in pytorch.

> This project is a part of the course **Deep Machine Learning (SSY340)** from Chalmers University of Technology.
